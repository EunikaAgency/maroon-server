                    [snippet] => Ed and his team at Newline Painting did an outstanding job on repainting the interior of my home in South Melbourne! They were swift, tidy and professional throughout the entire project —5 stars wouldn’t be enough to rate their work. They weren't the cheapest quote we got but they definitely kept their promise on timeline, professionalism and their quality of work. Keep up the great work, guys! Highly recommend Newline Painting!

I appreciated how Martin kept me up to date daily, letting me know the plan for the day. From customer service to the painting, everything went smooth from start to finish. I would recommend these guys to anyone!

                    [snippet] => I had a very good experience with Newline Painting. Quoting system had a quick response, with equally quick arrival of painter to confirm the details and a final quote was posted. Rate per sqm, was within my expectations and the painter got to work within 7 days from initial contact. The painter (Bill) kept in regular contact with me, confirming detail along the way and worked at a cracking pace. Was generous with his time on the job and the finished product was very good. Highly recommended.

I came across Newline Painting’s ad and thought I’d give them a shot since I’m selling the place and needed a quality job. Honestly, the whole process was super smooth, their customer service was really attentive, and their lead painter, Ed, was professional and detail-oriented. Overall, a great experience!

                    [snippet] => We recently purchased a unit in Melbourne. We contacted Newline Painting a couple of weeks before our completion date to enquire whether they could paint the whole unit (walls, ceilings & all woodwork), before we moved in & while the property was empty. Newline were very efficient in understanding our needs and supplied us with an extremely competitive quote. We picked up the keys on Friday, Newline started work on the Monday and were finished by Thursday. The quality of their work is amazing. We wanted two bedrooms painted different colours - “no issue, choose the colours and we’ll get it done” was their response. Fantastic customer service from start to finish. Would definitely recommend Newline Painting.

Ed and his team at Newline Painting did an outstanding job on repainting the interior of my home in South Melbourne! They were swift, tidy and professional throughout the entire project —5 stars wouldn’t be enough to rate their work. They weren't the cheapest quote we got but they definitely kept their promise on timeline, professionalism and their quality of work. Keep up the great work, guys! Highly recommend Newline Painting!

Martin and his team did an job painting my full house exterior. They were fast and efficient. I appreciated how Martin kept me up to date daily, letting me know the plan for the day. From customer service to the painting, everything went smooth from start to finish. I would recommend these guys to anyone!

I had a very good experience with Newline Painting. Quoting system had a quick response, with equally quick arrival of painter to confirm the details and a final quote was posted. Rate per sqm, was within my expectations and the painter got to work within 7 days from initial contact. The painter (Bill) kept in regular contact with me, confirming detail along the way and worked at a cracking pace. Was generous with his time on the job and the finished product was very good. Highly recommended.

I had a bad experience with the painters who worked on my property in St Kilda before I owned it. I came across Newline Painting’s ad and thought I’d give them a shot since I’m selling the place and needed a quality job. Honestly, the whole process was super smooth, their customer service was really attentive, and their lead painter, Ed, was professional and detail-oriented. Overall, a great experience!

We recently purchased a unit in Melbourne. We contacted Newline Painting a couple of weeks before our completion date to enquire whether they could paint the whole unit (walls, ceilings & all woodwork), before we moved in & while the property was empty. Newline were very efficient in understanding our needs and supplied us with an extremely competitive quote. We picked up the keys on Friday, Newline started work on the Monday and were finished by Thursday. The quality of their work is amazing. We wanted two bedrooms painted different colours - “no issue, choose the colours and we’ll get it done” was their response. Fantastic customer service from start to finish. Would definitely recommend Newline Painting.

Their workers kept me updated on every single step of the painting process for my house and always quickly responded when I asked about anything. On the last week they even worked through the weekend to finish off the job. Definitely a service I would recommended from my experience.

We hired Newline Painting to refresh our deck and sand and restain our hardwood decking. Edward and his team did amazing work, completed the project on time, at a fair price, and were a pleasure to work with. 5 Stars!
